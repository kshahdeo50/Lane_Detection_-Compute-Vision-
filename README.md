Automatic Detection of road lanes for self driving cars using computer vision


Lane detection is a challenging problem. It has attracted the attention of the computer vision community for several decades.
Essentially, lane detection is a multifeature detection problem that has become a real challenge for computer vision and machine learning
techniques. Although many machine learning methods are used for lane detection,
they are mainly used for classification rather than feature design. 
But modern machine learning methods can be used to identify the features that are rich in recognition and have achieved
success in feature detection tests.
